Budget support is a method of financing a recipient country\u2019s budget through a transfer of resources from an external financing agency to the recipient government\u2019s national treasury. The funds thus transferred are managed in accordance with the recipient\u2019s budgetary procedures. Funds transferred to the national treasury for financing programmes or projects managed according to different budgetary procedures from those of the recipient country, with the intention of earmarking the resources for specific uses, are therefore excluded."
