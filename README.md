# Unlocking a trillion dollars for development

How do we raise a trillion dollars to address poverty and climate change… without breaking the bank?

## We need a lot more money
Whether it’s climate change, poverty, the cost of living crisis, or any of the other challenges 
we face today, there is one common thread. We need money to help prepare and respond. A lot of it.

Credible estimates put the costs in the trillions of dollars — an order of magnitude greater 
than what’s currently on the table, particularly for lower income countries.

The good news is that institutions exist that were designed to safeguard financial 
stability and mobilise money to invest in global challenges. The bad news is that they are 
underused, out of date, and in need of a refresh. Those institutions are called 
multilateral development banks (MDBs). Collectively they hold $1.9 trillion in 
assets and could leverage hundreds of billions, up to a trillion dollars, more in
new lending if they used that capital more efficiently.
